-----priority-----
figure out a proper way to detect object collision
    current event_brickzones
        breaks when duplicated, zones dont carry over, forcing player to reenter events
        tick rate of 20ms does not detect fast moving players (120+ BPS or so)
    we want to avoid playertouch and actual brick collision for smoothness
        thorouhgly test high ping players with whatever collision method is found

gamemode objects
    dash panel
    spring
    boost ring
    diagonal variants


design test map 

design ramp optimizer script
    search through brickgroup for all modter ramps
        replace all ramps with static shape of the blb?
        replace all ramps with an elongated shape of the blb?
        i dont bloody know

design first map

-----secondary-----
create baseline emitters and make them look not ugly
add sling boost sound logic (extend sound, run tick to end sound on slowdown, add mini boost sound)
add stomp emitter and sound
    tick logic

-----tertiary-----
fix audio being weird in first person. centered on player which screws with direction?
weird airdash airborne edge cases
grind rails?









-----much later / needs some foundation-----
design prints (u turn)
design extra emitters
track system
    loading
    leaderboard
    racing
    nomination
    rtv (based on time and # completed)
item system
    shop, currency
    setting trail and hats
    maybe setting sounds..
object collision dll
    toggle for all players
