-----priority-----
aura logic 
    mount base aura to body? need to stop it flipping over
    start using auraticks

change sling logic to run on energy
    show energy bar
    consider adjusting tick logics to just use simtime
        or just using basic schedule


-----secondary-----
adjust air dash to maintain speed if kept at relatively straight angles
add sling boost sound logic (extend sound, run tick to end sound on slowdown, add mini boost sound)
drift emitter looks ugly
boost emitter looks ugly




-----tertiary-----
fix audio being weird in first person
drifting stutter
    due to setmaxcrouchforwardspeed, also not present in singleplayer?
    i dont know it just kind of happens randomly









-----much later / needs some foundation-----
ramp static shapes
    optimize ramps script, load in static shapes for certain ramp bricks
design gamemode objects (spring, dash panel, boost ring)
design prints (u turn)
design extra emitters
track system
    loading
    leaderboard
    racing
    nomination
    rtv (based on time and # completed)
item system
    shop, currency
