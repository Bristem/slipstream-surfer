VEHICLE BUBBLES CAN BE A TEMPLATE FOR BOOST AURA

aura logic 
    replace crouch with a simple square datablock, mount to head
    begin aura on boost
    start using auraticks
change sling logic to run on energy
    show energy bar
    consider adjusting tick logics to just use simtime
        or just using basic schedule
emitter and particles  
    replace drift projectile spam with image and emitter, maybe burnemittera
    boost: emitter of laser aura that spread out more than the basic aura
    projectile sphere explosion on sling
        air ring particle trail


-----secondary-----
adjust air dash to maintain speed if kept at relatively straight angles
add sling boost sound logic (extend sound, run tick to end sound on slowdown, add mini boost sound)




-----tertiary-----
fix audio being weird in first person
fix aura flipping over when looking down (mountpoint?)
drifting stutter
    due to setmaxcrouchforwardspeed, also not present in singleplayer?
    i dont know it just kind of happens randomly









-----much later / needs some foundation-----
ramp static shapes
    optimize ramps script, load in static shapes for certain ramp bricks
design gamemode objects (spring, dash panel, boost ring)
design prints (u turn)
design extra emitters
track system
    loading
    leaderboard
    racing
    nomination
    rtv (based on time and # completed)
item system
    shop, currency
    setting trail and hats
    maybe setting sounds..
object collision dll
