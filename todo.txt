adjust sound volumes (lower drift and dash)
add sling boost sound logic (extend sound, run tick to end sound on slowdown, add mini boost sound)
change sling logic to run on energy
    show energy bar
adjust air dash to maintain speed if kept at relatively straight angles

consider adjusting tick logics to just use simtime
    or just using basic schedule


design emitter and particles
    attach aura after air dash and sling
        maybe air dash burst projectile?  
    projectile sphere explosion on sling
        gonna need dts animations

design gamemode objects (spring, dash panel, boost ring)
design prints (u turn)
design extra emitters
